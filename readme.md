To foster openness, replicability, and efficiency, `tacmagic` facilitates loading and analysis of positron emission tomography data in R.

As a `tacmagic` is a new package, we strongly recommend checking all work against existing analyses to confirm the results are as expected, and welcome any feedback.

## Installation

The stable version of the package can be installed from CRAN, and the more recent development version can be installed with the devtools package. 

Use the following R commands to download the version you would like: for the CRAN release,  `install.packages("tacmagic")`, for the github release version that may not yet be available on CRAN, `devtools::install_github("ropensci/tacmagic")`, and for the very latest in-development version that is more likely to have bugs or errors and thus is not suitable for production use, use `devtools::install_github("ropensci/tacmagic", ref="devel")`.

## Features

The features of `tacmagic` are demonstrated in the package's walkthrough vignette, which is highly recommended for first-time uses.

### Data loading and weighted-averages

Time-activity curve (TAC) and/or region of interest (ROI) volume data can be loaded from various file formats including [PMOD](https://www.pmod.com/web/) .tac and .voistat files, a .mat file from the [magia](http://aivo.utu.fi/magia/) pipeline, and [Turku PET Centre's](http://turkupetcentre.fi) .DFT format. 

There is support for converting the radioactivity units in TAC data.

This package is not affiliated with any of the above pipelines.

### Time-activity curve plotting

Basic plotting of one or more TAC from one or more participants is available.

### Binding potential models

Non-invasive models are implemented including the standardized uptake volume (SUV), SUV ratio (SUVR), and the non-invasive Logan reference method.

### Batch and group-wise analysis

Loading and analysis functions can be run as a batch or by individual participant.
